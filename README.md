This is the notebook for the course

I will take notes on each "important" topic that I think 
is good to know.
This is because I want to have all the contents in 
one place, to find the answer to a problem in a more
comfortable way.

English is not my native language so feel free to change or
correct my grammar errors just if you want. Sorry if I 
misspelled something.
